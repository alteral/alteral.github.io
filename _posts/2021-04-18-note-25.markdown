## Introduction

Have you ever come across a *Github Actions* workflow that ~~stumbled into level ground~~ failed without good reason? If so I believe you're well familiar with this ruthless button:

![Re-run jobs](/assets/images/note_25_1.png)

Yeah, the thing is that it restarts absolutely all the jobs (*<span style="color:lime">green</span>*, *<span style="color:red">red</span>*, *<span style="color:grey">whatever</span>*), even if just the only one has failed. You can imagine how annoying this can be. While *Github Actions* doesn't provide a way to re-run just the failed jobs out of the box, let's build something on our own.

## Implementation

### Step-by-step guide

1. Set up a step to get the current timestamp

    ```yml
    - id: timestamp
      run: echo "::set-output name=timestamp::$(timestamp +%s)"
    ```

2. Name a cache container using the above timestamp

    ```yml
    - uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: |
          run_result
        key: ${{ "{{ github.run_id " }}}}-${{ "{{ github.job " }}}}-${{ "{{ steps.timestamp.outputs.timestamp " }}}}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ "{{ github.run_id " }}}}-${{ "{{ github.job " }}}}-
    ```

3. Restore the previous result

    ```yml
    - id: run_result
      run: cat run_result 2>/dev/null || echo 'default'
    ```

4. Set up a condition for further steps

    ```yml
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      if: steps.run_result.outputs.run_result != 'success'
    ```

5. Save the result on success

    ```yml
    - run: echo "::set-output name=run_result::success" > run_result
    ```

- [Action](https://github.com/alteral/re-run-only-failed-jobs-on-github-actions/actions/runs/760987512)
- [Workflow](https://github.com/alteral/re-run-only-failed-jobs-on-github-actions/actions/runs/760987512/workflow)

## Pros

- CI time will be noticeably reduced
- Developers nerves will be safely rescued
- This approach is 100% configurable and can be implemented only for the chosen jobs and steps

## Cons

- The only drawback I could come up with is that the logs of the successful jobs will be cleared on re-run

## Conclusion

The idea was to make our *Github Actions* more flexible and compromisable to speed up the development cycle, avoid time-consuming obstacles and increase fault tolerance.

Although this pattern is controversial enough, but on the other hand, you are now fully equipped to give your failed jobs a second chance *(:*
