## Introduction

Today I want to write about sniffing network traffic on *Android*. Let me show you what we had before and what we have after *Android Nougat*:

In other words, *Google* removed the feature to sniff a network traffic out of the box in *Android Nougat*. Furthermore, it means, that you won’t be able to sniff a network traffic in apps from *Play Market*.
Thereby, we should install network security config manually to resurrect sniffing feature. There are two ways to do it:
- add n*etwork_security_config.xml* in the source
- inject *network_security_config.xml* in an *.apk* file

## Addition network_security_config.xml in the source

- default

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest ... >
    <application android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
                    ... >
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

- custom

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <domain-config>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">example.com</domain>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="@raw/my_ca"/>
        </trust-anchors>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```

But there is a high probability, that *Google* may reject apps have *network_security_config.xml*, because it’s a «care» about peace, rock 'n' roll and safety.

## Injection network_security_config.xml in an .apk file

Here we are able to build a release *.apk*, duplicate it and make a *network_security_config.xml* injection. So, let’s start:
1. Build an *.apk*
2. Clone the repo:
  ```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/levyitay/AddSecurityExceptionAndroid.git
  ```
3. Run a script from the repo:
  ```bash
$ ./addSecurityExceptions.sh yourApp.apk
  ```
  - the script unpacks your *.apk* via *apktool*
  - injects *network_security_config.xml* into *AndroidManifest.xml*
  - signs and repacks your *.apk*
4. Your app is ready for test, install it and enjoy the sniffing
