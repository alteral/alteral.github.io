# - What is «Waiting»?

Lifeguard from flaky tests.

# - What variety do we have?

Hmm, let me think… 🤔

## We knew about *[Idling Resources](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/idling-resource)*.

*Pros:*
- It’s the most honest, fastest, and technically perfect way to wait;
- It doesn’t eat up the memory.

*Cons:*
- Sometimes it’s not a bit easier than writing production code;
- Sometimes we’ll have to touch production code;
- Most cases will probably require the own *Idling Resources*.

## We heard about *[sleeps](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#sleep(long))*.

*Pros:*
- Kill me then.

*Cons:*
- We’ll probably wait longer than we need;
- We’ll perhaps wait less than we need.

## We were guessing about the hacky way of injecting *[UiAutomator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/uiautomator-testing)*.

*Pros:*
- That’s something close to us since the time of *[Selenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software))*.

*Cons:*
- We’ll have to set an excess addiction;
- We’ll be limited by *minSdkVersion = 18*;
- We’ll have to play with weird *[UiObjects](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/test/uiautomator/UiObject2)*.

# - Go on, what about something else?

Okay… 😏

## Let’s try one hacky way using *Espresso*.

At first we have to extend ViewInteration class by adding new methods:
- *isDisplayed(): Boolean*
- *doesNotExist(): Boolean*
- *waitForAppear(millis: Long): ViewInteraction*
- *waitForDisappear(millis: Long): ViewInteraction*

Then we can try to use it in the tests:

*Pros:*
- Nothing is easier than use it for all the cases;
- We’re able to control the waiting timeout for each case.

*Cons:*
- *Logcat* will be littered;
- After all, it a bit eats up the memory (comparing with *Idling Resources*).

# - Conclusion?

Yeah, waits are the delicate matter:
- Follow the deadlines, needs, requirements and sanity;
- Do whatever you want (using Espresso, of course 🧐);
- Enjoy! 😉
