## Introduction

There are two ways to download *iOS* app from *Apple App Store* for your attention:

**1.** Using [*Apple Configurator 2*](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fapple-configurator-2%2Fid1037126344) (legal way)
- Here you need to have an app on your phone.

**2.** Using anyone *iOS* executable dumper (illegal way)
- Here you have to be *Jailbroken*.

## Using Apple Configurator

**1.** Download an app from *App Store* to your phone

**2.** Open *Apple Configurator 2* on your *Mac* and log into your *Apple* account

**3.** Connect your phone to your *Mac* using a *USB* cable

**4.** Into *Apple Configurator 2* select your phone

**5.** Then tap on the «Add» button in the top, then tap on Apps button

**6.** Choose the app and tap on «Add» button

**7.** Finally it could tell you an app already exists, but don’t worry — just be in a hurry to grab an *.ipa* using this path:

```bash
~/Library/Group\ Containers/K36BKF7T3D.group.com.apple.configurator/Library/Caches/Assets/TemporaryItems/MobileApps/
```

## Using anyone iOS executable dumper

As I said for this method you will need a *Jailbreak*. It can be illegal and provoke side effects, so do it at your own risk. When writing this article I used [*Checkra1n*](https://cydia-app.com/checkrain/) and [*frida-ios-dump*](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump) for this purpose.

**On device:**

**1.** Make a *Jailbreak*

**2.** Open *Cydia* app

**3.** Add the source [https://build.frida.re](https://build.frida.re)"

**4.** Search for *Frida* and install it

**On computer:**

**1.** Install [*frida*](https://frida.re/)

```bash
$ pip3 install frida-tools
```

**2.** Install [*frida-ios-dump*](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump.git
$ cd frida-ios-dump
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

**3.** Install [usbmuxd](https://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/SSH_Over_USB)

```bash
$ brew install usbmuxd
```

**4.** Connect to your phone using *ssh*

```bash
$ iproxy 2222 44 & sleep 3
$ ssh -p 2222 root@localhost # default password: alpine
```

**5.** Open a new *Terminal* window and pull decrypted *.ipa*

```bash
$ cd frida-ios-dump
$ python3 dump.py "<your_bundle>" # default password: alpine
```
