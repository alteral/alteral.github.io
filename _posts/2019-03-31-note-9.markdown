Sometimes, when we would like to install another’s *iOS* app on our device we might to come across with *«Application Verification Failed»*.
It can be rare case, because it is really a concatenation of circumstances and means, that you received the app without your team’s *provision profile*. Anyway we are able to solve this problem.

## Plan

1. Get own *provisioning profile*
2. Resign the app
3. Install the app

## Precondition

First of all, to make our life better and easier, we should install *ideviceinstaller* and *fastlane*:

```bash
$ brew install ideviceinstaller
$ gem install fastlane
```

## Provisioning profile

Then we need to get a provision profile. If you already have it, you can jump to the next step, if not, let’s go on.

**As *Apple* said**:

*Xcode* is the easiest way to create an *iOS provisioning profile*. Connect your device to your *Mac* and click *Use for Development* in *Xcode’s Organizer* window. Sign in with the *Apple ID* associated with your *Apple Developer Program* membership and *Xcode* will generate a *provisioning profile* containing your certificate and device identifier.
{: .notice--info}

So, in this case it doesn’t matter of signing type, will it be personal team or organisation team.

## Resign the app

Here we need three things:
- *.ipa*
- *.mobileprovision*
- *iOS Developer Certificate*

I hope you have got an *.ipa*, other ones we can get from *Xcode*:

{: center: style="text-align: center;"}
![Xcode image](/assets/images/note_9_1.png)
{: center}

**So**:

- drag and drop *iOS Team Provisioning Profile* from *Xcode* tooltip into the folder with *.ipa*
- copy *iPhone Developer Certificate* from the same tooltip
- then resign the app via *fastlane* like this:

```bash
$ fastlane sigh resign testapp.ipa --signing_identity "iPhone Developer: a.alterpesotskiy@test.com (KJRTP5GJS9)" -p "test.mobileprovision"
```

## Install the app

{: center: style="text-align: center;"}
![Success](/assets/images/note_9_2.gif)
{: center}

**P.S.**:

If you see this pop-up, you can go to **Settings => General => Device Management** on the device to trust the developer and allow the app to be run (see [*Apple* documentation](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT204460) for more information):

{: center: style="text-align: center;"}
![Popup](/assets/images/note_9_3.png)
{: center}

## Conclusion

To sum it up, I would say that *«Application Verification Failed»* is hardly a problem. Now we can install any *.ipa* on any devices *(:*
