## Introduction

There are three ways to download android app from *Google Play Store* for your attention:
- Using third party websites (easiest, but not the safest way)
- Using device on *Android* (the most secure and exact way)
- Using [*google-play-cli*](https://github.com/dweinstein/node-google-play-cli) (automation friendly way)

## Using third party websites

- [https://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader](https://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader)

As I said, this is not the provenest and the safest method, so use it at your own risk *(:*

## Using device on Android

1. At first you need to install app from Play Store to your phone

2. Secondly you should enable «*Unknown sources*» in your phone’s security settings (*Settings => Security => Unknown sources*)

3. Then connect your phone to your *PC* using a *USB* cable/*WiFi* (*adb* needs to see it)

4. Make sure you have installed *adb*

5. Download an *.apk*:

```bash
$ bundleId="<your_bundle>"
$ apk=`adb shell pm path $bundleId`
$ apk=`echo $apk | awk '{print $NF}' FS=':' | tr -d '\r\n'`
$ adb pull $apk app.apk
```

## Using Google-Play-CLI

The best way to make this process automated.

1. Install [*google-play-cli*](https://github.com/dweinstein/node-google-play-cli):

    ```bash
    $ brew install node
    $ npm i google-play-cli -g
    ```

2. Set environment variables in your *bash.profile*:

    - *GOOGLE_LOGIN* - email address used on a mobile phone.
    - *GOOGLE_PASSWORD* - The password used to access the *Play Service*.
    - *ANDROID_ID* - the device *GSF ID* for *Google*. You can get the *gsf id* e.g., using the [*device id app*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.deviceid&hl=en).

    ```bash
    $ touch .bash_profile
    $ open .bash_profile
    $ export GOOGLE_LOGIN=sample@gmail.com
    $ export GOOGLE_PASSWORD=password
    $ export ANDROID_ID=a3n3d3r3o3i3d3i3d
    $ source .bash_profile
    ```

3. Download an *.apk*:

    ```bash
    $ gp-download "<your_bundle>" > app.apk
    ```
